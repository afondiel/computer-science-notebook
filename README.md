# Research Notes

## Overview

As a Software Engineer Consultant, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of topics in the **automotive** and **agriculture** industries, including electrification and sustainability, safety and comfort, and more.

So, I decided to compile some resources from my previous and ongoing work that software engineers looking to get into any tech industry might find useful, including core skills, projects, and tools.

## Motivation

The big picture behind this project is to create a "Hello World" Notebook, sort of [Whole "Software Engineering" Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog), that Software Engineers, Developers and Computer Science Students can use as an aide-memoire or a "prompt" for their daily work, interview preps and study checklist, etc.

## Topics 

Topics covered include requirements, design, programming languages, and testing. You may also find some research papers and notebooks about AI, [Prompt Engineering & LLMs](https://github.com/afondiel/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-DeepLearningAI), ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics, and more.
