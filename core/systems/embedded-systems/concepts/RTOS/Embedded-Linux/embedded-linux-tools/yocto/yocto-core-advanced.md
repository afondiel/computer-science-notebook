## Introduction
### What
Yocto provides a highly modular and scalable framework to build customized Linux distributions for embedded systems, supporting BSP development, security hardening, and real-time applications.

### Why
- Enables fine-grained control over system components.
- Optimizes resource usage for embedded devices.
- Supports production-grade reliability, security, and compliance.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability for large-scale deployments.

### Where
Widely used in aerospace, industrial automation, autonomous systems, telecommunications, and automotive industries.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **BitBake Advanced Usage**: Customizing task execution, creating multi-stage builds, and optimizing dependencies.
- **Custom Metadata & Layers**: Developing advanced Yocto layers for BSPs, security, and device drivers.
- **Kernel and Device Tree Customization**: Integrating custom patches and real-time capabilities.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implementing secure boot, SELinux, and verified boot mechanisms.
- **Common Misconceptions**: Yocto is not just a Linux distribution but a framework for building tailored distributions.

## Implementation Details
### Advanced Topics [Advanced]
```bash
# Customizing BitBake Execution Order
bitbake -g core-image-full-cmdline && cat task-depends.dot | dot -Tpng -o task-dependencies.png

# Building an Optimized Kernel with Custom Patches
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto.git
cd linux-yocto
git checkout custom-branch
bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
bitbake -c compile virtual/kernel

# Enabling Secure Boot
bitbake -c menuconfig u-boot
bitbake -c compile u-boot
```
