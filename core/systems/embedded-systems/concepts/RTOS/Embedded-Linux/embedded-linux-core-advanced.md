## Introduction

### What

Embedded Linux is an adaptation of the Linux operating system optimized for high-performance embedded applications, offering real-time capabilities, security, and extensive driver support.

### Why

It provides an open-source, flexible, and cost-effective alternative to proprietary RTOS solutions while enabling customization for mission-critical applications.

### Where

Used in avionics, autonomous robotics, industrial edge computing, medical imaging, and 5G networking infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

### Fundamental Understanding

- Kernel customization: Low-latency patches, real-time scheduling, kernel module tuning.
- System optimization: Minimizing memory footprint, reducing boot time below 1 second, power management techniques.
- Security considerations: Secure boot, trusted execution environments (TEE), kernel hardening.
- Common misconceptions: Preempt-RT alone does not make Linux fully deterministic; real-time behavior depends on hardware and software co-design.

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Topics [Advanced]

```bash
# Example: Enabling full real-time capabilities with PREEMPT_RT
cd linux-src
git apply patches/rt.patch
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
# Enable CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, disable unneeded kernel features
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j8
make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=<target_rootfs>

```

- System design: Deterministic scheduling strategies, kernel bypass techniques, FPGA offloading.
