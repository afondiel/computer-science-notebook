## Introduction
### What
VxWorks is a high-performance, real-time operating system (RTOS) used for mission-critical embedded applications that require deterministic execution and minimal latency.

### Why
It provides highly configurable real-time scheduling, optimized resource management, and robust security features for embedded systems.

### Where
VxWorks is deployed in safety-critical environments, including aerospace avionics, autonomous vehicles, industrial robotics, and high-performance networking.

## Core Concepts
### Advanced Understanding
- **Deterministic real-time scheduling**: Hard real-time constraints with interrupt-driven execution.
- **Multi-core processing**: Symmetric (SMP) and asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) for parallel execution.
- **Advanced memory management**: Memory partitioning, MMU support, and zero-copy communication.
- **Safety and security**: Memory protection, secure boot, and DO-178C compliance for avionics.
- **Real-time networking**: Low-latency TCP/IP stack and deterministic data transmission.

### Key Components
- **Wind Kernel**: The core scheduler and execution engine providing preemptive multitasking.
- **Task Management**: Dynamic priority-based scheduling with real-time constraints.
- **Inter-task Communication (IPC)**: Fast message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Low-latency ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) processing.
- **Filesystem and I/O**: Flash-friendly file system (FFS), network file system (NFS), and device management.

### Common Misconceptions
- **VxWorks cannot handle modern multi-core architectures**: Supports SMP, AMP, and mixed-mode execution.
- **RTOS guarantees infinite CPU time for high-priority tasks**: Requires careful load balancing and watchdog monitoring.
- **Memory protection is unnecessary for real-time applications**: MMU-based protection is crucial for reliability and security.

        semGive(sem);
        taskDelay(10);
    }
}
void lowPriorityTask() {
    while (1) {
        semTake(sem, WAIT_FOREVER);
        printf("Executing low-priority task\n");
        semGive(sem);
        taskDelay(50);
    }
}
void start() {
    sem = semMCreate(SEM_Q_PRIORITY | SEM_INVERSION_SAFE);
    taskSpawn("highTask", 50, 0, 4000, (FUNCPTR)highPriorityTask, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    taskSpawn("lowTask", 100, 0, 4000, (FUNCPTR)lowPriorityTask, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
}
