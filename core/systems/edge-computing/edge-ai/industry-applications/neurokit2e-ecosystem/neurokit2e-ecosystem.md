## **Products and Services**

### **Core Offerings**
- **[AIDGE Platform*](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.aidge)**: A deep learning framework designed for embedded AI, offering:
  - Neural Network design, optimization, and deployment.
  - Integration of hardware models with neural network models.
  - Advanced compression and pruning methods to reduce model size while maintaining performance.
  - Support for synchronous (tensor-based) and event-driven (spiking) coding in a single development chain.
- **N2D2 Platform**: Developed by CEA (the project coordinator), this tool facilitates neural network design and deployment for embedded applications.

### **Use Cases**
- Applications include automotive systems, industrial IoT, healthcare devices, and building automation. For example:
  - Codasip's "Occupancy Monitoring for Efficient Building Control" use case leverages radar sensors with RISC-V hardware to process data locally.
