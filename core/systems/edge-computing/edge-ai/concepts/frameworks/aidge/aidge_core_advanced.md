## Introduction
- **What**: Deploying with Aidge, based at [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/aidge/aidge](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/aidge/aidge), is the process of designing, simulating, optimizing, and deploying sophisticated DNNs onto hardware targets (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, DSPs) with a focus on production-ready embedded systems.
- **Why**: It tackles the challenge of achieving high performance, low latency, and minimal resource usage in real-world AI deployments, offering advanced users tools to fine-tune models and integrate them into complex systems.
- **Where**: Deployed in high-stakes domains like autonomous driving, industrial automation, aerospace, and large-scale IoT networks.

## Core Concepts

### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic Principles**: Deployment with Aidge involves advanced DNN design, multi-stage optimization (e.g., quantization, pruning, kernel fusion), and deployment across heterogeneous hardware, emphasizing scalability and real-time constraints.
- **Key Components**:

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Topics [Advanced]

[Python & C++]
```python
# Example: Optimizing and deploying a DNN for production with Aidge
from aidge_core import Model
from aidge_optimization import Quantizer, KernelFusion  # Hypothetical advanced modules

# Load a complex model
model = Model.import_onnx("complex_model.onnx")  # Replace with your ONNX file

# Simulate with production workload
input_batch = [load_batch_data()]  # Custom function for batch data
output = model.run(input_batch)
print("Baseline performance:", measure_latency(output))

# Optimize: Quantization + Kernel Fusion
quantizer = Quantizer(model, precision="int8")  # Reduce to 8-bit integers
quantized_model = quantizer.quantize()
fusion = KernelFusion(quantized_model)
optimized_model = fusion.fuse_kernels()  # Combine operations for efficiency

# Export to GPU with TensorRT
optimized_model.export("tensorrt", "prod_model.trt", optimization_level="O3")
print("Deployed to prod_model.trt")
```

[C++ snippet for integration]
```cpp
// Example: Running the deployed model on GPU
#include "tensorrt_model.h"
int main() {
    TensorRTModel model("prod_model.trt");
    float* input = prepare_input_batch();  // Custom data prep
    float* output = model.infer(input);
    log_performance(output);  // Custom logging
    return 0;
}
```

- **System Design**: Use a modular pipeline with optimization stages (quantization, fusion) and hardware-specific backends.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Apply int8 quantization for speed, fuse kernels to reduce overhead, and leverage hardware intrinsics.
- **Production Considerations**: Ensure fault tolerance (e.g., error handling), scalability (batch processing), and monitoring integration.
