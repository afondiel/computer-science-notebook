## Introduction  
- **What**: Deploying AI on edge devices with AIMET means adapting pre-trained AI models to run on low-power, resource-limited hardware using techniques like quantization and pruning provided by AIMET.  
- **Why**: It enables faster, offline AI processing, reduces latency, and saves bandwidth compared to cloud-based solutions.  
- **Where**: Used in IoT devices, autonomous drones, smart home systems, and other edge computing scenarios.  

## Core Concepts  
### Fundamental Understanding  
- **Basic principles**: Edge devices have limited memory and processing power, so AI models must be lightweight. AIMET optimizes models by reducing their size and complexity (e.g., converting 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers via quantization) while preserving accuracy.  
- **Key components**:  
  - Pre-trained AI model (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).  
  - AIMET toolkit for optimization.  
  - Target edge hardware (e.g., Qualcomm Snapdragon, Raspberry Pi).  
- **Common misconceptions**:  
  - "Edge AI is less accurate" – With AIMET, accuracy loss is minimal.  
  - "You need advanced hardware" – Basic devices can work with proper optimization.

- **System overview**: A model is trained, optimized with AIMET, and deployed to an edge device for inference.  
- **Component relationships**: AIMET bridges the gap between heavy models and edge constraints.  

## Implementation Details  
### Basic Implementation  
```python  
# Example: Quantizing a simple model with AIMET  
import tensorflow as tf  
from aimet_tensorflow import quantsim  

# Load a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet)  
model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')  

# Configure AIMET for quantization  
sim = quantsim.QuantizationSimModel(model, quant_scheme='tf')  

# Simulate quantization (fake quantization to test)  
sim.compute_encodings(forward_pass_callback=lambda m, _: m.predict(data),  
                      forward_pass_callback_args=None)  

# Export optimized model  
sim.export('/path/to/output', 'quantized_mobilenet')  
```  
- **Step-by-step setup**:  
  1. Install AIMET (`pip install aimet-tensorflow`).  
  2. Load a pre-trained model.  
  3. Apply quantization using AIMET.  
  4. Test and export the model.  
- **Code walkthrough**: The code loads MobileNetV2, simulates quantization, and saves an optimized version.  
- **Common pitfalls**: Forgetting to test on real data or skipping hardware compatibility checks.  

## Real-World Applications  
### Industry Examples  
- **Use case**: Smart security camera detecting motion offline.  
- **Implementation pattern**: Quantized model deployed on a low-power chip.  
- **Success metrics**: Reduced power usage, real-time detection within 50ms.  

### Hands-On Project  
- **Project goals**: Deploy a quantized image classifier on a Raspberry Pi.  
- **Implementation steps**:  
  1. Train a simple CNN on MNIST dataset.  
  2. Use AIMET to quantize it.  
  3. Deploy to Raspberry Pi and classify handwritten digits.  
- **Validation methods**: Measure accuracy and inference time (aim for <1s).
