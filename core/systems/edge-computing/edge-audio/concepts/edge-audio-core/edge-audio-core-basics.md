# Edge Audio Technical Notes
<!-- A rectangular diagram illustrating the edge audio process, showing an audio input (e.g., a sound wave from a microphone) captured on an edge device (e.g., a microcontroller), processed with basic feature extraction (e.g., amplitude analysis), analyzed using a simple algorithm (e.g., threshold-based detection), producing an output (e.g., triggering an alert), with arrows indicating the flow from capture to processing to action on the device. -->

## Introduction
- **What**: Edge audio involves capturing and analyzing audio on small, low-power devices to perform tasks like detecting a clap to turn on a light or recognizing a simple voice command.
- **Why**: It enables fast, private, and energy-efficient audio processing without needing constant internet connectivity or powerful servers.
- **Where**: Used in smart home devices (e.g., doorbells), wearables, and industrial sensors for tasks like audio-based alerts or voice control.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic Principles**:
  - Audio is captured as a digital signal on an edge device, typically sampled at low rates (e.g., 8-16 kHz) to save power and memory.
  - Processing involves extracting simple features (e.g., amplitude or energy) and running lightweight algorithms (e.g., threshold-based detection) on the device.
  - Edge devices prioritize low power, small memory, and real-time performance, limiting the complexity of audio tasks.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Audio Capture**: Using a microphone and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to convert sound into digital samples.
  - **Feature Extraction**: Computing basic metrics like root mean square (RMS) energy or zero-crossing rate to represent audio.
  - **Analysis Algorithm**: Simple decision rules (e.g., if energy exceeds a threshold, trigger an action) optimized for low-resource hardware.
  - **Edge Device**: Hardware like microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) with limited CPU, memory, and power.
- **Common Misconceptions**:
  - Misconception: Edge audio requires powerful hardware.
    - Reality: Simple tasks can run on low-cost microcontrollers with optimized code.
  - Misconception: Edge audio is only for speech processing.
    - Reality: It includes non-speech tasks like detecting environmental sounds (e.g., glass breaking).

- **System Overview**: The diagram shows an audio signal captured on an edge device, processed into features, analyzed, and producing an action.
- **Component Relationships**: Capture converts sound to data, feature extraction simplifies it, analysis interprets it, and the output drives device actions.

## Implementation Details
### Basic Implementation
```c
// Arduino sketch for basic edge audio sound detection
#include <Arduino.h>

// Pin configuration
const int MIC_PIN = A0; // Analog input pin for microphone
const int LED_PIN = 13; // LED pin for output

// Parameters
const int SAMPLE_RATE = 8000; // Hz
const int SAMPLE_WINDOW = 128; // Samples per window
const float THRESHOLD = 0.1; // RMS threshold for detection

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Capture audio samples
  float samples[SAMPLE_WINDOW];
  for (int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_WINDOW; i++) {
    samples[i] = analogRead(MIC_PIN) * (3.3 / 1023.0); // Convert to voltage
    delayMicroseconds(1000000 / SAMPLE_RATE); // Sampling delay
  }

  // Compute RMS energy
  float sum_squares = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_WINDOW; i++) {
    sum_squares += samples[i] * samples[i];
  }
  float rms = sqrt(sum_squares / SAMPLE_WINDOW);

  // Threshold-based detection
  if (rms > THRESHOLD) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    Serial.print("Sound detected! RMS: ");
    Serial.println(rms, 4);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
    Serial.print("No sound. RMS: ");
    Serial.println(rms, 4);
  }

  delay(100); // Small delay to avoid flooding serial output
}
```
- **Step-by-Step Setup**:
  1. Install the Arduino IDE (download from arduino.cc).
  2. Connect an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) with a microphone module (e.g., electret mic with amplifier) to pin A0 and an LED to pin 13.
  3. Save the code as `edge_audio_beginner.ino`.
  4. Upload the sketch to the Arduino via the IDE.
  5. Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to view RMS values.
- **Code Walkthrough**:
  - Captures audio samples from a microphone at 8 kHz using `analogRead`.
  - Computes RMS energy over a 128-sample window to measure sound intensity.
  - Turns on an LED and prints a message if RMS exceeds a threshold (0.1V).
  - Uses minimal resources suitable for a microcontroller.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Incorrect microphone wiring or insufficient amplification causing weak signals.
  - Sampling rate mismatch due to inaccurate delay timing.
  - Overloading the Arduino with too frequent serial output.

## Real-World Applications
### Industry Examples
- **Use Case**: Voice-activated smart doorbell.
  - Detects a specific sound (e.g., a knock) to trigger a notification.
- **Implementation Patterns**: Capture audio, compute RMS energy, and use threshold detection to activate a buzzer or alert.
- **Success Metrics**: High detection accuracy (>95%), low power consumption (<10mW).

### Hands-On Project
- **Project Goals**: Build a sound-activated LED using an Arduino.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Set up the above circuit with a microphone and LED on an Arduino.
  2. Upload the code and clap near the microphone to test detection.
  3. Observe the LED lighting up and Serial Monitor output.
