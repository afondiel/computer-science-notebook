## Introduction
### What
Vision agents are sophisticated AI systems that integrate multi-modal computer vision perception with stateful decision-making architectures, enabling context-aware, adaptive behavior in complex, dynamic environments through continuous perception-action cycles.

### Why
Vision agents address limitations of traditional computer vision by maintaining environmental state, handling uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning, and enabling robust decision-making across extended interaction sequences with graceful failure recovery.

### Where
Vision agents operate in robotics (autonomous navigation, manipulation), smart infrastructure (surveillance, traffic management), AR/VR systems, industrial automation, and healthcare (patient monitoring, surgical assistance).

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic principles**: Vision agents implement hierarchical perception (low-level detection â†’ high-level scene understanding), maintain belief states over environmental dynamics, use probabilistic decision frameworks, and support multi-modal sensor fusion for robust operation.
- **Key components**:
  - **Hierarchical Perception Pipeline**: Combines object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, and scene graph generation.
  - **Belief State Manager**: Tracks environmental state, agent confidence, and temporal dynamics using Kalman filters or particle filters.
  - **Hierarchical Decision Engine**: Combines rule-based FSMs with RL policies and planning algorithms.
  - **Action Planning & Execution**: Supports hierarchical task planning with motion planning and feedback control.
- **Common misconceptions**:
  - Single-frame perception suffices: Agents require temporal consistency and state tracking.
  - Rule-based decisions scale: Complex scenarios need hybrid RL/planning approaches.
  - Vision-only is sufficient: Multi-modal fusion (lidar, IMU) improves robustness.

```
- **System Overview**: Multi-modal sensor data feeds hierarchical perception, updating belief states that inform decision engines, which generate action hierarchies executed through planning and control systems with continuous monitoring.
- **Component Relationships**: Perception maintains scene understanding, belief states handle uncertainty, decisions coordinate planning, and execution provides feedback for continuous adaptation.
