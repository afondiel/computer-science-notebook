## Introduction
### What
Advanced vision agents implement end-to-end autonomous systems combining multi-modal sensor fusion, transformer architectures for spatio-temporal perception, hierarchical decision-making with model-based RL, real-time scene graph reasoning, and distributed edge-cloud inference with fault-tolerant execution and continuous learning capabilities.

### Why
Advanced vision agents address the limitations of single-modal perception and reactive control by providing robust, adaptive intelligence that handles uncertainty, rare events, and long-horizon planning while maintaining real-time performance guarantees and production reliability through distributed computing and continuous adaptation.

### Where
Deployed in safety-critical systems (autonomous vehicles, medical robotics), high-throughput industrial automation, immersive AR/VR environments, and defense applications requiring robust perception-action loops under extreme conditions and adversarial scenarios.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic principles**: Advanced vision agents implement end-to-end differentiable perception-action pipelines using spatio-temporal transformers, Bayesian belief propagation for uncertainty quantification, hierarchical model-based RL with world models, and distributed inference with dynamic workload partitioning between edge and cloud.
- **Key components**:
  - **Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer**: BEV (Bird's Eye View) fusion of LiDAR-RGB-D-IMU data with cross-attention mechanisms.
  - **Scene Graph Memory**: Dynamic knowledge graphs with temporal evolution and uncertainty propagation.
  - **Hierarchical World Model**: Latent dynamics models for long-horizon planning and counterfactual reasoning.
  - **Model-Based RL Controller**: MBPO/MuZero-style planning with differentiable physics simulation.
  - **Distributed Inference Engine**: ROS2-DDS middleware with edge-cloud orchestration and fault tolerance.
- **Common misconceptions**:
  - End-to-end learning solves everything: Explicit world models and hierarchical planning are crucial for sample efficiency and safety.
  - Single-device inference suffices: Distributed edge-cloud architectures are required for real-time guarantees.
  - Static models work in production: Continuous adaptation and rare-event handling are essential.

- **System Overview**: Multi-modal data feeds transformer-based fusion, generating dynamic scene graphs that update belief states and world models, driving hierarchical RL planning executed through distributed edge-cloud infrastructure with continuous learning.
- **Component Relationships**: Each module maintains differentiable interfaces for end-to-end optimization, with distributed execution balancing latency constraints and computational complexity.
