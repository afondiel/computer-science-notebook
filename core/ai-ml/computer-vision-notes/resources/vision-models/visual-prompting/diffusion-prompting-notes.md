## Introduction
### What's stable diffusion prompting?
Stable diffusion prompting is a technique for generating realistic and diverse images from text descriptions using a deep neural network model called **Stable Diffusion**.

### Applications
Stable diffusion prompting can be used for various creative and artistic purposes, such as:
- Generating portraits, landscapes, animals, and other scenes from keywords or sentences
- Creating stylized images with different mediums, styles, and effects
- Enhancing or modifying existing images with negative prompts
- Exploring novel and unexpected combinations of concepts and attributes

## Fundamentals
### How stable diffusion prompting works?
#### Stable Diffusion Architecture Pipeline

Stable diffusion prompting works by using a text encoder and an image decoder in a pipeline. 

- The text encoder converts the text prompt into a vector representation, called an embedding, that captures the semantic meaning of the text. 

- The image decoder takes the embedding as an input and generates an image that matches the text prompt. 

- The image decoder is based on a stable diffusion model, which is a type of generative model that can produce high-quality and diverse images by gradually adding details and noise to a random initial image³.

## Tools & Frameworks
There are several tools and frameworks that can be used to perform stable diffusion prompting, such as:
- Stable Diffusion Art: A web-based platform that allows users to generate images from text prompts using various models and settings⁴
- How-To Geek: A website that provides tutorials and tips on how to write effective and awesome prompts for Stable Diffusion⁵
- Generative Labs: A blog that covers topics related to generative art and AI, including prompt syntax and FAQ for Stable Diffusion
- Mockey: A tool that helps users create and share mockups and prototypes using Stable Diffusion
- AI Writing Hacks: A website that offers a step-by-step guide on how to write Stable Diffusion prompts, with examples and best practices

## Hello World!
Here is a simple example of how to generate an image from a text prompt using Stable Diffusion Art:

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
To practice and improve your stable diffusion prompting skills, you can try some of these projects:
- Generate a self-portrait or a portrait of someone you admire using Stable Diffusion
- Create a logo or a banner for your website or business using Stable Diffusion
- Make a collage or a poster of your favorite movies, books, or games using Stable Diffusion
- Design a cover or a illustration for a story or a song using Stable Diffusion
- Invent a new creature or a character using Stable Diffusion
