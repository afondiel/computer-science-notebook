# Batching and Fusing: Concepts, Math, and Practical Impact

**Batching** and **fusing** are key techniques for optimizing neural network computations, particularly matrix multiplications.

---

**Batching**

- **Concept:** Instead of processing one input at a time, batching processes multiple inputs simultaneously. Each input in the batch is represented as a row in a matrix, allowing a single matrix multiplication to compute the outputs for all batch items in parallel[2][5][7].

- **Math:**  
  If $$ X $$ is a $$ b \times m $$ input matrix (batch size $$ b $$, input features $$ m $$), and $$ W $$ is an $$ m \times n $$ weight matrix (output features $$ n $$), then the output is:
  $$
  Z = XW
  $$
  $$ Z $$ is a $$ b \times n $$ matrix, where each row is the output for one input in the batch[5][7].

- **Impact:**  
  - Maximizes hardware utilization (especially on GPUs/TPUs).
  - Reduces overhead from repeated kernel launches or function calls.
  - Enables efficient memory access patterns due to contiguous storage[5].
  - Essential for high-throughput training and inference.

**Fusing**

- **Concept:** Fusing combines multiple sequential operations (like matrix multiplication, bias addition, and activation) into a single computational kernel.

- **Math:**  
  Instead of computing:
  $$
  Z = XW \\
  Z' = Z + b \\
  A = \text{activation}(Z')
  $$
  Fusing performs all steps in a single pass, reducing the need to write/read intermediate results to memory.

- **Impact:**  
  - Reduces memory bandwidth usage by minimizing intermediate reads/writes.
  - Lowers kernel launch overhead.
  - Improves cache locality and overall throughput, especially for deep or wide networks.

**Practical Implementation**

- Modern frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) automatically handle batching and often fuse common patterns like linear + bias + activation.
- When implementing custom kernels, ensure input matrices are stored in row-major order for efficient batching[5].
- Always verify input/output shapes to avoid common dimension mismatches[6].

**Summary Table**

| Technique | Main Benefit                   | Typical Use Case                |
|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Batching  | Maximizes parallelism, speed   | Training/inference with batches |
| Fusing    | Reduces memory ops, overhead   | Linear + bias + activation      |

Batching and fusing are foundational for efficient neural network computation, enabling high throughput and effective hardware utilization[4][5].

## Practical Use Case: Batched & Fused Linear Layer in Python (NumPy)

Here's a minimal example of a batched matrix multiplication with bias addition and activation (fusing) using NumPy.

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def linear_fused(X, W, b):
    # X: (batch_size, input_dim)
    # W: (input_dim, output_dim)
    # b: (output_dim,)
    # Fused: matmul + bias + activation
    return relu(np.dot(X, W) + b)

# Example data
batch_size, input_dim, output_dim = 4, 3, 2
X = np.random.randn(batch_size, input_dim)
W = np.random.randn(input_dim, output_dim)
b = np.random.randn(output_dim)

# Batched and fused forward pass
output = linear_fused(X, W, b)
print("Output:\n", output)
```

**Explanation:**
- `X` is a batch of 4 samples, each with 3 features.
- `W` is the weight matrix, and `b` is the bias.
- `linear_fused` computes all outputs in one step: matrix multiply, add bias, and apply ReLU activationâ€”demonstrating both batching and fusing.

**Impact:**
- Processes all samples in the batch simultaneously (batching).
- Reduces memory operations and improves cache locality by fusing steps.
- This approach is the basis for efficient implementations in deep learning libraries[1][3][4].
