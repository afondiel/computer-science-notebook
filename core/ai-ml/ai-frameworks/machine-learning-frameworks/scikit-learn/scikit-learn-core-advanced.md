  - Advanced techniques like custom transformers, Bayesian optimization, and model interpretability ensure scalability and production readiness.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Custom Transformers**: User-defined preprocessing steps (e.g., `BaseEstimator`, `TransformerMixin`) for tailored feature engineering.
  - **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models (e.g., `StackingClassifier`, `VotingRegressor`) for improved accuracy and robustness.
  - **Automated Tuning**: Tools like `Optuna` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for efficient hyperparameter optimization across large search spaces.
- **Common Misconceptions**:
  - Misconception: Scikit-learn is limited to traditional ML algorithms.
    - Reality: It supports advanced ensembles, custom pipelines, and integration with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow.
  - Misconception: Scikit-learn cannot scale to production.
    - Reality: With proper pipeline design and serialization (e.g., `joblib`), it supports production-grade deployment.
