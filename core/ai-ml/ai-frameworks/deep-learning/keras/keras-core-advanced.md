## Introduction
### What: Core Definition and Purpose
Keras is an open-source deep learning framework designed to enable fast experimentation with neural networks. It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training models, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

### Why: Problem It Solves/Value Proposition
Keras simplifies the process of building and training neural networks by abstracting away much of the complexity. It allows users to focus on designing models rather than dealing with low-level implementation details.

### Where: Application Domains
Keras is widely used in:
- Image Classification: Identifying objects in images.
- Text Analysis: Sentiment analysis, text generation.
- Time Series Forecasting: Predicting future values based on historical data.
- Recommendation Systems: Personalizing user recommendations.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic Principles**:  
  - Layers: The building blocks of neural networks (e.g., Dense, Conv2D, LSTM).  
  - Models: A collection of layers that define the architecture of a neural network.  
  - Optimizers: Algorithms used to update model parameters during training (e.g., Adam, SGD).  
  - Loss Functions: Measures of how well the model is performing (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy).  

- **Key Components**:  
  - Input Layer: The starting point of the model where data is fed in.  
  - Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers that transform the input data.  
  - Output Layer: The final layer that produces the model's predictions.  

- **Common Misconceptions**:  
  - Keras is a standalone framework: Keras is now part of TensorFlow and is often referred to as TensorFlow Keras.  
  - Keras is only for beginners: While Keras is beginner-friendly, it is also powerful enough for advanced use cases.

## Implementation Details
### Advanced Topics [Advanced]
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define a custom layer
class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Define a model using the custom layer
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = CustomLayer(64)(inputs)
x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(x)

model = models.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mean_squared_error',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example training data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Make predictions
x_test = np.random.rand(10, 10)
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
print(predictions)
```
