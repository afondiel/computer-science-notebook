## Implementation Details
### Advanced Topics [Advanced]
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io, filters, segmentation, color, feature, measure

# Read an image from file
image = io.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)

# Apply Gaussian blur to the image
blurred_image = filters.gaussian(gray_image, sigma=1)

# Detect edges in the image using the Canny edge detector
edges = feature.canny(blurred_image, sigma=1)

# Perform image segmentation using watershed algorithm
markers = filters.rank.gradient(blurred_image, np.ones((3, 3))) < 10
markers = measure.label(markers)
segments = segmentation.watershed(edges, markers)

# Display the original and processed images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(20, 5))
axes[0].imshow(image)
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
axes[1].imshow(blurred_image, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Blurred Image')
axes[2].imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
axes[2].set_title('Edges')
axes[3].imshow(segments, cmap='nipy_spectral')
axes[3].set_title('Segments')
plt.show()
```
