## Implementation Details
### Intermediate Patterns [Intermediate]
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io, filters, segmentation, color

# Read an image from file
image = io.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)

# Apply Gaussian blur to the image
blurred_image = filters.gaussian(gray_image, sigma=1)

# Detect edges in the image using the Sobel filter
edges = filters.sobel(blurred_image)

# Perform image segmentation using Felzenszwalb's algorithm
segments = segmentation.felzenszwalb(image, scale=100, sigma=0.5, min_size=50)

# Display the original and processed images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(20, 5))
axes[0].imshow(image)
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
axes[1].imshow(blurred_image, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Blurred Image')
axes[2].imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
axes[2].set_title('Edges')
axes[3].imshow(segments, cmap='nipy_spectral')
axes[3].set_title('Segments')
plt.show()
```

- **Design Patterns**:  
  - Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into multiple regions or objects.  
  - Edge Detection: Using the Sobel filter to identify edges.  

- **Best Practices**:  
  - Use appropriate parameters for segmentation to balance detail and noise.  
  - Visualize intermediate results to debug and optimize processing steps.  

- **Performance Considerations**:  
  - Optimize image processing steps to reduce computational load.  
  - Use efficient algorithms for feature detection and segmentation.
