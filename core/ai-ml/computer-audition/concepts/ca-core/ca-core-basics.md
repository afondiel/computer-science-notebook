# Computer Audition Technical Notes
<!-- A rectangular diagram illustrating the computer audition process, showing an audio input (e.g., a sound wave) processed through feature extraction (e.g., converting to a spectrogram), fed into a model (e.g., for classification), producing an output (e.g., identifying speech or music), with arrows indicating the flow from sound to analysis to result. -->

## Introduction
- **What**: Computer audition involves teaching computers to "listen" to and interpret audio, like recognizing words in speech or identifying sounds in a room.
- **Why**: It enables applications like voice assistants, automatic music tagging, and detecting specific sounds (e.g., alarms) in noisy environments.
- **Where**: Used in smart devices (e.g., Alexa), music streaming services, security systems, and research into audio processing.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic Principles**:
  - Audio is represented as a digital signal (a series of numbers capturing sound wave amplitude over time).
  - Computer audition processes audio by extracting features (e.g., frequency patterns) and using them for tasks like classification or transcription.
  - Models learn from labeled audio data to recognize patterns, such as distinguishing speech from background noise.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Audio Signal**: A digital representation of sound, typically sampled at rates like 44.1 kHz (CD quality).
  - **Feature Extraction**: Converting audio into formats like spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for analysis.
  - **Models**: Algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) that classify or interpret audio based on features.
- **Common Misconceptions**:
  - Misconception: Computer audition is just speech recognition.
    - Reality: It includes music analysis, environmental sound detection, and more.
  - Misconception: You need advanced math to start.
    - Reality: Beginners can use libraries like Librosa to process audio with minimal math.

- **System Overview**: The diagram shows an audio signal processed into features, fed into a model, and producing an output like a classification label.
- **Component Relationships**: Feature extraction transforms raw audio, the model analyzes features, and the output is the interpretation.

## Implementation Details
### Basic Implementation
```python
# Example: Simple audio classification with Librosa and Scikit-learn
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Simulate loading audio files (replace with real audio paths)
# Here, we use dummy data for simplicity
def extract_features(audio_path):
    # Load audio file (replace with actual file loading)
    y, sr = np.random.randn(22050), 22050  # Dummy audio
    # Extract MFCC features
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfcc, axis=1)  # Average MFCCs

# Dummy dataset: 10 audio samples, 2 classes (e.g., speech vs. music)
X = np.array([extract_features(f"audio_{i}.wav") for i in range(10)])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # Labels: 0=speech, 1=music

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
- **Step-by-Step Setup**:
  1. Install Python (download from python.org).
  2. Install dependencies: `pip install librosa scikit-learn numpy`.
  3. Save the code as `audio_classifier.py`.
  4. Run the script: `python audio_classifier.py` (replace dummy data with real audio files).
- **Code Walkthrough**:
  - The code simulates classifying audio as speech or music using MFCC features extracted with Librosa.
  - `librosa.feature.mfcc` converts audio into features capturing frequency patterns.
  - A `RandomForestClassifier` learns to distinguish classes based on features.
  - Accuracy is calculated to evaluate performance on test data.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting to install Librosa or its dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SoundFile).
  - Using inconsistent audio formats (e.g., different sampling rates) without preprocessing.
  - Not normalizing features, which can reduce model accuracy.

## Real-World Applications
### Industry Examples
- **Use Case**: Voice assistant command recognition.
  - A smart speaker uses computer audition to detect and interpret voice commands like "play music."
- **Implementation Patterns**: Extract MFCCs from audio, train a classifier to recognize keywords.
- **Success Metrics**: High accuracy in noisy environments, low latency for real-time response.

### Hands-On Project
- **Project Goals**: Classify audio clips as "speech" or "music."
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Collect 5 speech and 5 music audio clips (e.g., WAV files, ~5 seconds each).
  2. Modify the above code to load real audio files using `librosa.load(audio_path)`.
  3. Extract MFCC features and label data (0 for speech, 1 for music).
  4. Train and test the classifier; print accuracy.
- **Validation Methods**: Achieve >90% accuracy; verify predictions on a few test clips.
