What's a Data Science ? 
***********************

/!\ Data Science is a process to understand data and do differents things
- keywords : trends, insights, data structured and unstructured, expore, manipulation, find answers, recommendation

# Fundamentals of Data Scienstis : 
- Data Analysis (question problem ? => Find Answers => Create Value)
- Data Science (Deal with different type of datas) : log files, social medias, email, sales data, patient info files, sports perfomance data, sensor data, security camera ...
- !!! Be curious !!!
- Data visualization => to explain => trends, to tell history, to detect a pattern, new behaiviour ...

# Many path to Data Science

# A day in life of Data Scientist ?
- > /!\ Find solution by analyzing datas
- > Curious, fluency in analysis, good communication=>story teller

# Old vs new problems ? 
- old => Predict congestion (uber taxi)
- new => Environment, Climate Changes
- Find (new) solution  : 
		=> Identify the problem  \
		=> Gather datas     	  \ BUILD A MODEL !!!!
		=> Identify 			  /
		=> Tools				 /

# Topics algorithms
- list : regression, data viz, neural net, nearest neighbour, classification ...
- strutured data : ranged /organized data (EXCEL row,colomns) 
- unstructured data :  comes from sensors(video, audio...), web not in row /colomns


# Clouds for Data Scientist ?
- Cloud : Cloud allows to access to data, collaborate easy
- Cloud : storage data, high performance computing, save physical space in own computer, simulations work in the same data
=> IBM : IBM Cloud
=> Amazon : Amazon Web Services(AWS)
=> Google  : Google Cloud Platform
=> Tools : Hadloop, stata ...

# Big Data and Data Mining 

* def *
1st/ approach (traditional) : Statistical analysis
2nd/ Approach : unsupervised + machine-learning algorithms.

* Goal * : to explore hitherto unknown trends and insights by subjecting data to analysis

- Big Data and Data Mining ?
- Foundations of Big Data ?
- What is Hadoop ?

Big Data(BD) : Dynamic, large, Disperate volume of data, created(apps, machine, tools ...)

* 5Vs : 
	=> Velocity : Speed data (quick RT)
	=> Volume :	 Scalable (2,5 quintillons bytes => 10 millions DVDS)
	=> Variety :	Diversity => data come from diffrent Sources (audio, video, img ...) 
	=> Veracity : qlity / origin of data (Releablity, accuracy)
	=> Value : turns data to value (Solution, profits..)

Data scientist extract/drives data from big data
 Tools : 
	=> Apache sparks
	=> Hadoop (created by Dong Cutting ) => based on Data Cluster, splits data into a pieces to computing a large amount of data (gain speed, performance ...)
 
- How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
		    CEO => working w/ them and the financial department to adapt the needs

	/ 					\
  CDO						CIO 
(Chief Data Officer)		(Chief Information Officer)

- R
- Unix/Lunix
- Maths(Algebra Statistics)
- Jupyter note book + AWS (Virtual Account)
- BIG DATA (concept created by Google, Statistical technics to handle large data)

- Data Scientists at New York University ?

- Data Mining ?

7 Steps Down the Data Mining : 

1. Establish data mining goals
 - set up goals for the exercise.
 - identify the key questions that need to be answered
 - costs and benefits of exercise
 - Define expected exercise resultats and accuracy
 - High levels of accuracy from data mining would cost more and vice versa.
 
2. Select data

 - The output of a data mining exercise largely depends upon the quality of data being used.
 - Data might be available 
 - If Data not available then go to  : plan new data collection initiatives, including surveys 
 - The type of data, its size, and frequency of collection have a direct bearing on the cost
 - Datas come from differents Databases
 
 
3. Preprocess data
 - clean
 - identify relevant attributes
 - identify the irrelevant attributes of data
 
4. Transform data
 - determine the appropriate format in which data must be stored
 - data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena
  --- using Data reduction algorithms
 - store data in the variables
 
5. Store data
 - Storing Data into the right/good Data mining format for immediate read/write
 - new variables can be created to store data and temporary write/read back into the database
 - store data on servers or storage media that keeps the data secure
 - Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data.


6. Mine data
 - After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining
 - data analysis methods
 - including parametric
 - non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
 /!\ - data visualization : good starting point for data mining
 - Multidimensional views of the data
 - data mining software
 - FIND  : HIDDEN trends in the data se
 
7. Evaluate data mining results
 - Extract the result 
 - Do a formal evaluation 
 - > Testing the predictative capabilities of the model
 - > effitiency & of the algorithms in the producing data
 
 /!\ in-sample forecast
 
 -> Share the result w/ Stakeholders
 -> improve the quality of the resultat from the shared feedback

##########################
# Machine Learning Models - Learning from data to make predictions
##########################
- Data can contain a wealth of information
- traditional programming approach reaches its computer limit due to the alarge amount size of data
=> Solution : Machine Learning Model : algorithms which learn from experiences by identifying patterns and predicts the result  
- A model must be trained on data before it can be used to make predicts 
types of ml learning classes : 
=> Supervised (most commun) : Data is labeled and model trained to make correct predictions (input data(X), corrected output (y))
	examples : 
	- regression : predict real numerical values (home sales prices, stock market)
	- classifications : classify things into Categories (email spams filters, fraud detection, image classification)
=> unsupervised : data is not labeled. Model tries to identify patterns w/out external help
	- clustering and anomaly detection
=> reinforcement : Conceptually similar to human learning processes
	- a robot learning to walk, Go, Chess and other strategy games
##########################
# Deep Learning Models 
##########################
- Tries to loosely emulate how human brain works
Applications : 
=> Natural Language Processing
=> Image,Audio, and video analysis
=> Time Series forecasting
=> Much more
=> LARGE datasets of labeled data and compute intensive

- Build from scratch / download from public model repos
- frameworks : TensoFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- populars model repos : 
=> model zoo
=> ONNX model zoo 

ML /DL Pipeline-process
--------------+--------------+----------------+		+-----------
Prepare Data => Build Model => Training model				  ... => Deploy model
---------------+---------------++--------------+		+-------------
=> Prepare Data  : (collect data , clean, label)  
=> Build Model : from scratch/ zoo model that fits to the problem
=> Training Model(iterative process ) : requires (more) data, time, expertise, ressources
=> Deploy model : make available for the application

- jupyter created from ipython 
- A tool for recording Data Science experimentation
- It allows Data Scientist to combine text and code block in a signle file
- It generates plots and tables within the file
- Notebooks can be exported as pdf and html files

JupyterLab : open multiple jupyter files

Jupyte Environment
- Google Collab
- IBM 

## Installation : 

```pip install JupyterLab ``` or from ANACONDA 

SKILLS NETWORK : virtual jupyter notebook nothing to be installed

virtual jupyter notebook : https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/tools/jupyterlite/lab/tree/labs/DS0105EN/Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb?lti=true

# Getting Started w/ Jupyter
- open on SKILLS NETWORK
- slide mode to deliver the work
- terminate the session (before leaving the jupyterlab ? ) 

# Jupyter Kernels
- A notebook kernel : computational engine that excutes the code contained in a Notebook file
- Jupyter Kernels for many other languages exist
- the kernel perfoms the computational and produces results, when the notebook is executed
- Other notebook languages can be need based on the Environment

# Jupyter Architecture
- implements a 2 process model : kernel - client
- client : interface enabling the user to send code to the kernel
- Kernel : execute the code and returns to the client for display
- the client is the browser when using jupyter notebook

(user) -> (browser) -> (Notebook server) -> (Kernel)
